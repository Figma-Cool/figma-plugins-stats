Sure, until you need to design an entire data table, or a dozen different cards of the same variety, at which point you’ll be wishing for an easier way to go about it. Luckily, now there is! This plugin allows you to effortlessly pull text and images from an Airtable database and inject them straight into your Figma components. Using the plugin is child’s play. First, you build your component in Figma, business as usual. Then, you load up the Airtable 2 Figma plugin, and map the Airtable data fields to the right layers in Figma. Finally, choose the layout you want your component to be laid out as and voilà, you just saved yourself a couple hundred clicks!

To find out which options are available and how they are named, check out the following library: https://github.com/Jam3/xhr-request\nExample usage:\n{\n  \"headers\":{\n     \"secret-key\":\"XXX\"\n  }\n}\n\nNotes\n- Supports only JSON\n- You need to manually select which arrays to loop through after selecting the path\n- Data connected to Component layers do not get transferred to its instances. In this case, connect the data to the instance instead, when you copy an instance the data stays connected.\n- To multiply layers quickly, install the Multiply plugin\n- If you the amount of layers on your page exceeds the limit, the info on the sync page will not auto-refresh when something changes on the page, instead you can use the manual refresh button. This is done to improve performance.\n\nLet me know on Twitter if you have questions, requests or feedback!","id":"784880696244762700","installCount":1914,"lastUpdateDate":"2020-08-13T23:25:00.799Z","likeCount":72,"name":"API / JSON Sync","publisherHandle":"eminsinani","publisherId":"649","publisherName":"Emin Sinani","viewCount":80007},{"description":"<p>This plugin generates a dark/light theme from your selection.</p><p>The plugin works with external library styles and local styles.</p><p>You can choose styles name identification in settings.

Set direction to horizontal and adjust padding/alignment to your liking. You can change the order by moving layers up and down in the layers sidebar. \n4. With the frame selected, set Height to ‘Resize To Fit’ in AutoLayout which will automatically resize the frame when the text field gets longer\n5. Duplicate the frame a few times below to create a list of todos\n6. Wrap all todo items in a frame and enable AutoLayout, set the direction to vertical. You can adjust spacing between the items.\n7.

The Plugin will look for those layers and set the text and change the color. \n\nDate Formatting\nAny text nodes that layer name starts with an # symbol will be set based on the date formatting. Follow the momentjs formatting. Ie: MMMM will result in January. The display syntax style that is in the component will be copied to the date text, for example, if the MMMM is all red and set to font size 20 these properties will be copied over. This applies to text and fills styles.\n\nYou can hide and show text just for days and months with special filters.

No need to worry about JSON, naming prefix, selection, etc. Good for developing color systems, projects require multiple color themes (like dark mode and light mode), and giving your design a new look.\n\nFeatures\n\nSave Color Theme\nCarefully name your current color theme and it will be saved within the Figma file you are working with. This will save all local color styles into a color theme. Note color styles in color themes will not update when you modified local color styles, you need to manually save changes to color themes.\n\nApply Color Theme\nChange to an entirely different look by applying a color theme with only one click. Your local color styles will be replaced by ones from the color theme you choose.\n\n Import/Export Color Themes\nDue to the current Figma Plugin API limitation, transferring data across Figma file can not be streamlined. A second-best solution is offered by Color Theme Manager, simply copy your saved color theme into clipboard and paste to another file.\n\nHow?\n\nColor Theme Manager will look for color style from a saved theme with the exact same name and replace the local style. So name your color styles (and color themes) wisely. Repeated names will cause unexpected results.\n\nFuture\n\n- Features like auto update, read/write to libraries can not be implemented efficiently with the current set of APIs. This might change when new APIs come out.\n- Color styles involve image fill is not implemented very efficiently.

Separate the names with a '.' .\n\nWhen selected, all layers will be hidden, expect the chosen one.\n\nE.g.: [Color.Blue], [Color.Green] creates a group 'Color' in which you can choose between 'Blue' and 'Green' colors.\n\n• CONDITION VARIABLES\nShow or hide a layer based on a condition.\n\nName the layer wrapping it in parenthesis. This will create a toggle for the variable name which you can show/hide on the panel. \n\nE.g.: (disabled)\n\nYou can create an inverse condition by naming the layer starting with a '!' .\n\nE.g.: (!disabled)\n\n__________________\n\nNOTES\n\n• The variables should be created on the master component, keeping in mind not to rename the layers on the instance.\n\n• The configuration panel works only with instances.\n\n• You can create multiple layers with the same name to get the same behaviour on them.","id":"819995136233235915","installCount":1151,"lastUpdateDate":"2020-03-12T19:11:30.741Z","likeCount":58,"name":"Component Variables","publisherHandle":"luizmoura","publisherId":"529811","publisherName":"Luiz","viewCount":79804},{"description":"Browse and insert local and team components via a flyout menu.

Open the source library document and launch this plugin.\n2. Click \"Add Team Library\".

Name the component anything you'd like, but make sure it ends with \" ? \" followed by the name of the condition it represents. Example: \"Header ? Anonymous\" or \"Navigation / Bottom Tabs ? Anonymous\"\n\n3. Place instances of the component into any places within your design you'd like it to appear.\n\n4. Create a new conditional variation, also at the top level within the page. You can do this by duplicating the original component and changing overrides, or you can make a completely new frame with completely different content. Make the new instance or frame into a component, and name it to match the first conditional variation. Example: \"Header ? Logged-in\" or \"Navigation / Bottom Tabs ? Logged-in\"\n\n5. Repeat step 4 for as many conditional variations you'd like to make for this component.\n\n6. Wrap all the conditional variations together in one frame.

Your engineering team can use Crowdin API and CLI to set up instant content synchronization.</p><p><br></p><h2>Prototype with the Real Copy and Test Translated Versions</h2><p><br></p><p>Once the production-ready texts are uploaded to Crowdin, you can stop using <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> in your mockups.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Get the list of source strings, use the real copy in your mockups, edit texts if necessary, and send new strings for translation with the keys and screenshots for translators.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Upload translated mockups back to Figma and customize them before the development starts.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://support.crowdin.com/figma-plugin/#ui-localization\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more.</a></p><p><br></p><h2>Set up Continuous Workflow for App Localization</h2><p><br></p><p>App localization can now start at the prototyping step:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Designers send texts for translation to Crowdin with the keys, tags, and screenshots.</li><li>Translation teams work on the texts in Crowdin.</li><li>The translated variants are tested and customized back in Figma.</li><li>Development teams then download source and translate files from Crowdin and integrate them into the codebase.</li><li>Also, a separate technology allows downloading files in the&nbsp;<em>Android XML</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Strings</em>&nbsp;formats regardless of the initial source file format.</li></ul><h2><br></h2><h2>Use Different Translation Approaches</h2><p><br></p><p>In Crowdin, texts can be pre-translated via Machine Translation engines (Google Translator, Microsoft Translator, and others). You can also invite your in-house translators, freelancers, or an agency. Crowdin will create Translation Memory automatically, so you will be able to reuse translations and pre-translate texts using your TM in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>Human translators will have sufficient <strong>context</strong> while translating your content. When working on UI localization, you can automatically upload <strong>screenshots</strong> to the localization project.</p><p><br></p><p>When translating static pages, like posters and banners, translators will <strong>preview</strong> full frames in Crowdin and see the visual context for every text.</p><p><br></p><h2>How to Set Up</h2><p><br></p><p>To get started, you will need a Crowdin account and a localization project under it.

Note how all the layers within a component or instance will be populated with data from the same record.\n\n---------------\n\nAdding a data source\n\n  •  Try http://myjson.com/ for simple JSON hosting.\n  •  If you want to populate layers randomly, use arrays in your first level of JSON values, e.g. { “users\": [ object1, object2, …, objectN ], “jobs”: [ objectA, objectB, …, objectC ] }.\n  •  Data from these objects is referenced using curly brackets {…} and dot notation, allowing you to populate structured data like {users.name.first} and {jobs.description}.\n  •  If you only have a single array, you don’t need to reference the first key. E.g. for { “data\": [ object1, object2, …, objectN ] }, write {name.first} instead of {data.name.first}\n\nPopulating text\n\n  •  Populate an entire text layer by renaming the layer. \n  •  Alternatively populate a part of a text layer by adding your curly brackets within the text (e.g. “I love {location.city}” becomes “I love New York”). \n  •  The plugin remembers the parts it populated, so you can populate the same layers again and again.\n\nPopulating images\n\n  •  Populate images by renaming a shape layer. \n  •  The data source for images must be a URL to a hosted image.\n  •  Try https://source.unsplash.com/ for easy hosted images.\n\nPopulating a component/instance\n\n  •  When you select a bunch of regular layers, the plugin randomly chooses the records to populate them with. If you want them to all be populated from the same record, turn them into a component (or instance).\n  •  Add data to your library components so that they’re ready to go!\n\nRoadmap...?\n\n  •  Manage multiple data sources\n  •  Use data from google sheets and other sources\n  •  Basic functions like random() and if()\n  •  DM me suggestions!","id":"787488293482536319","installCount":1213,"lastUpdateDate":"2020-02-23T23:19:06.724Z","likeCount":53,"name":"Data Populator","publisherHandle":"ptrckmrgn","publisherId":"68","publisherName":"Patrick Morgan","viewCount":65594},{"description":"<p>Insert randomized data from Google Sheets into tagged layers in your designs.

Generate utility palette: extracts the dominant color from an image, suggests high-contrast text colors, and includes additional complementary palette information.\n2. Smart populate: takes your selection and intelligently sets layer fills and text colors based on nearby images.\n\nGenerating a dominant color palette\n\n1. Select one or more layers in Figma that contain image fills. \n1. Run the plugin Menu > Dominant Color Toolkit 🎨  and your palette will be generated. \n\nNote: To prevent overlapping frames from appearing in your designs, align your images 500px apart.\n\nSmart populate\n\n1. Select any frame, component, or instance\n2. Menu > Dominant Color Toolkit 🎨\n3. Command + Shift + P to re-run\n\nHow does Smart Populate work?\n- If you selected one or more frames which contain an image, shapes, and text, the plugin will use the first image it finds to automatically fill the shapes with the computed dominant color and set text layers to have a high-contrast fill against that dominant color.\n- If you selected an image along with shapes and text layers, the plugin will use the selected image to populate selected shapes with the computed dominant color and set text layers to use the high-contrast fill color.\n- If you selected shapes and text, but no image, the plugin will traverse outwards in your frame until it finds an image fill. This image will will then be used to populate the shapes and text with the dominant color and high-contrast text colors.\n\nNote: This plugin supports both image fills and background fills, using the first valid fill it can find. As a result, a frame with a background fill that has children shape and text layers will populate successfully!\n\nSecret options: If you'd like to text layers to the dominant color rather than high-contrast color, simply include the text \"dominant\" anywhere in the layer name!\n \nThis plugin is open source, contributions welcome: https://github.com/brianlovin/figma-dominant-color-toolkit\n\nCredits\n\ncolor-thief (https://github.com/lokesh/color-thief) for finding dominant colors and generating palettes","id":"744725347356614754","installCount":7117,"lastUpdateDate":"2019-08-23T14:56:22.880Z","likeCount":72,"name":"Dominant Color Toolkit 🎨","publisherHandle":"brian","publisherId":"22538","publisherName":"Brian Lovin","viewCount":104548},{"description":"Share your mockups directly to Chrome so developers have a pixel-perfect visual reference to build from.\n\n** How it works **\n\n1.

After it, GitHub Actions will convert them into React component code.\n- Publish to NPM: Finally, it'll publish processed code to NPM.\n- Install or update from NPM: Developers can use them through terminal execution, which is familiar to them.\n\n## Usage\nFor more details and docs you can visit https://github.com/leadream/figma-icon-automation.\nsupport: https://github.com/leadream/figma-icon-automation/issues","id":"739395588962138807","installCount":2503,"lastUpdateDate":"2020-06-21T09:23:02.720Z","likeCount":42,"name":"figma-icon-automation","publisherHandle":"leadream","publisherId":"39","publisherName":"Hal Lee","viewCount":87595},{"description":"<p>The Figma-Low-Code plugin allows you to use your Figma designs directly in <a href=\"http://VUE.js\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">VUE.js</a> applications.

Learn more at https://www.plasmic.app.\n\nThe importer fully automates the low-level details of converting Figma’s document representation to standard DOM representations. A few highlights:\n\n- Supports constraints and auto-layout.\n- Translates blend modes.\n- Adapts border styles including centered borders.\n- Handles filter effects like background blur and layer blur.\n- Preserves affine transformations like scales and rotations.\n- Handles all fill types including linear and radial gradients and images.\n- Imports vector and compound shapes as SVGs.\n- Mirrors the original hierarchical structure.\n- Carries over most type styles.\n\nOnce in Plasmic, the design could immediately be published as a standalone static website in CodeSandbox or your own codebase. But you will often also want to refactor the design into a more hygienic and lasting structure, suitable for production and for integrating with code. That’s where the rest of Plasmic’s toolset comes in, letting you take advantage of the richer layout, component structure (variants/slots), interactions, style abstractions (mixins/tokens), and element types (such as form elements) for functionality and accessibility. Plasmic’s core philosophy is to enable you to incrementally refine the messy and exploratory into the clean and robust.\n\nFollow https://twitter.com/plasmicapp for the latest updates.","id":"845367649027913572","installCount":961,"lastUpdateDate":"2020-08-04T06:48:10.958Z","likeCount":33,"name":"Figma-to-Code by Plasmic","publisherHandle":"99950f08_2df5_4","publisherId":"843254771306409369","publisherName":"Plasmic","viewCount":73675},{"description":"<p>GET FLUTTER CODE FOR FIGMA SELECTIONS</p><p>Flutter generator will look through what you select and write out the flutter equivalent</p><p><br></p><p>EASY COPY AND PASTE</p><p>Stateless code?

All of us have encountered cases where we need to add something to a component but don’t want that to show up in all the hundreds and thousands of existing instances. We finally end up creating a new component so that the existing work is not affected. This plugin solves this issue with a single click.\n\nFollow these steps to hide a particular layer from all component instances\n• Select the layer/group/frame that you want to hide from one of the instances of a component\n• Select Hide Layers from Instances -> Hide\n• The selected layer/group/frame will be hidden from all instances in the current page\n\nUse the Force Hide option if the layer that you want to hide is part of a component that is nested in multiple other components and you want to hide the layer in all of them at once.\nEg.: If you want to hide a layer in an icon component that is already used in various other components like different state and sizes of buttons, then Hide option will just hide the layer in the selected state or size of the button. Whereas Force Hide will hide the layer in all the instances of all the components that this icon is used.\n\nThis plugin works only on instances and not on components\nCAUTION: When using the Force Hide option. ensure that the name of the layer you are hiding is unique. If not, multiple layers may get hidden.\n\nFeels too small a feature for a plugin?

No exports, copying and pasting files, no code cleaning or additional optimizations. \n\nFor developers: Imagine that you receive a bunch of icons from your fellow designer. You have to extract needed data from all those SVG files... It's time consuming... Forget about it. Now you can easily export all icons data to a JSON file with one click! If you have a custom Icon component in React, Angular or Vue — that's all you need.\n\nHow it works:\n1. Create frames / components / instances with unique names (plugin seeks for every frame / components / instances in a current page)\n2. Draw icons or paste them from your favorite tool (like IconJar)\n3. Flatten them (if they are not already)\n4. Use the plugin to create a JSON with needed data\n5. Use data with your custom Icon component\n6. 🎉\n\nTip! Hidden frames, components or instances are skipped by the plugin\n\n=========================\nCustom components & examples:\n1.

Our design team has been slowly pulling our color libraries into Figma, and early on in the process, we realized this was a long and tedious task. Because the color themes for the products we work on can be quite extensive, manually creating color styles and a visual color guide takes a lot of time. We decided that Microsoft's Hackathon 2019 would be an excellent opportunity to team up and try and fix this problem. Over the course of three days, we built Kaleidocode to address the gap in our workflow and improve the design process not only for our team but anyone else designing for VS Code.\n\nKaleidocode's creators are Kaitlin Wilkinson, Miguel Solorio, and Pine Wu.","id":"736060893363678891","installCount":3303,"lastUpdateDate":"2019-08-02T23:58:07.001Z","likeCount":40,"name":"Kaleidocode","publisherHandle":"microsoft","publisherId":"1500","publisherName":"Microsoft","viewCount":68392},{"description":"<h2>With Keyboard Doodler, you can draw with your keyboard!</h2><p><br></p><p>Why would I want this?

One label for each selected layer is now created. The menu commands are used for both creating and updating labels, and layers can only have one label in the document at a time. \n\n⠀\nWhat you can do\n——————––––\n• Push and pull the latest names using sidebar shortcuts or the Figma menu\n• Find the layer linked to the current selection, even across different pages\n• Click on any label and restore its master component to edit label styles across your file\n• Leverage Figma's quick switch between text objects to rename several labels in a row, then propagate all changes to the layers' names\n\n⠀\nFAQ\n——\n• I don't see sidebar shortcuts on my layer!\nThat could be either because you didn't run the plugin from the menu on that layer at least once, or because you're using an instance of a component. Figma doesn't support registering sidebar shortcuts in instances yet, but the plugin still works from the menu.\n\n• Can I run it via a keyboard shortcut?\nFor many workflows, relying on Figma's native ⌘＋⌥＋P (Run Last Plugin) should speed things up enough. The plugin's commands don't distinguish between creation and update exactly so that the only shortcut we have is as smart as it can be. If you still want to register them permanently on your Mac, you can create custom shortcuts in macOS: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp2271/mac","id":"837733390949354788","installCount":583,"lastUpdateDate":"2020-05-11T09:27:22.906Z","likeCount":36,"name":"Label Maker","publisherHandle":"gusso","publisherId":"138","publisherName":"Henrique Gusso","viewCount":65581},{"description":"<p>Test your UI in different languages.</p><p><br></p><h2>Language Tester</h2><p>Opens a modal with a list of languages.

I became tired of manually applying export settings across assets and projects. So this was born March 21st, locked up in my apartment.\n\n⚡️ Lazy Export allows the user to apply default export settings to selected objects in Figma.\n\n🧠 How does it work?\nThere are two ways to trigger your export settings to be applied. The first is a window giving you UI access to run the plugin commands. (Set Platform, Apply Settings, Clear Settings)\nThe second is via the plugin menu; this makes the actions searchable in Figma with the `⌘+/` command.\n\n🔧  Currently supported:\n• IOS \n• IOS Adv.\n• Android\n• Android Adv.\n• Web\n\n📦 Export Options\n\n✨ Export Settings\nWith Lazy export, you have two mobile options on how you can apply export settings.\n\n• Default Export\n• Advanced Export\n\nWith the default export, this follows the trends for exporting assets for mobile at the different screen densities. Advanced is still being worked on for a smooth workflow.\n\nℹ️ The end goal for Advanced Export Options, would be for a developer to hit apply, and Figma exports a folder of assets the developer can drop into Android Studio or Xcode.\n\nAndroid Suffix\n`drawable-mdpi`\n\nIOS Suffix\n`/default-asset@1x`\n\nAndroid Advance Suffix\n`/drawable-mdpi/default-asset`\n\nIOS Advance Suffix\n`/default-asset.imageset/default-asset@1x`\n\n✍️ Custom Asset Naming\n\nRight now, if you do not apply a custom name to each asset, a default one will be used. \n    📆 I have plans on the roadmap to adjust this.\n\nDefault Name String = `default-asset`\n\n🐛 Have a feature request or bug?

Compare instances to their default main component and copy and paste the overrides.\n\nFeatures\n1. Copy and paste overrides between symbols\n\nTwo of Figma's greatest strengths are:\n\na. Overriding colors, text, and other properties on component instances, and \nb. Swapping out instances of components, such as a icons or states.\n\nBut when you swap an instance, you lose all the overrides you've made, including changes to nested instances within a parent component.\n\nMaximum Override allows you to copy your overrides, swap out an instance, and then paste the overrides back onto the new instance, to retain all of your changes. This includes nested instances that you've swapped with a different component.\n\n2. Compare properties between objects\n\nMaximum Override also allows you to select any two nodes on the stage and compare them against each other to see what's different. (In software, this is known as a \"diff\".) You can then copy the changes from object A to object B, or vice-versa. If you select a single instance, Maximum Override will compare it against its own main component.\n\n------------\n\nBugs? Suggestions? Contributions?

A few options will also be available to you to optimize how Paddet updates your paddings. The last used settings are saved for each frame so you can easily let paddy automagically update your paddings on the fly without having to check your settings again.\n\nFAQ\n* Can I use it on component instances?\nYes you can! Do keep in mind it will firstly apply the padding to your master component and update the selected instances afterwards. Another important note to mention is that whenever your master component updates all your instances will be affected as well, however paddy will not automatically update your instances for their respective content. If this is something you want you need to use the :paddet-autoupdate flag on the instance name\n\n* What does the :paddet-autoupdate flag do in the name of an instance?\nIf a component instance has this flag in it's name Paddet wil update the instance for it's content whenever Paddet is used on the master component.\n\n* What does using :paddet-ignore in my layer name do?\nThis flag will ensure Paddet does not take into account that layer when it is calculating the width and height of the current content. This is especially useful when you have a seperate layer for your background as you do not want this layer to be taken into account as actual content.\n\n* What does using :paddet-resize in my layer name do?\nUsing the resize flag will tell Paddet to resize it along with your frame.  As with the ignore flag, this is useful when you have a background layer.\n\n* Can I combine the ignore and resize flags?\nYes you can.\n\n* Will Paddet remember my settings?\nYes, whenever you update a frame with Paddet it will save your last used settings for that specific frame. This way you can use the \"Auto update padding\" option to easily re-update your paddings without having to open the complete plugin.","id":"734548932196004433","installCount":11343,"lastUpdateDate":"2019-08-24T10:08:58.118Z","likeCount":49,"name":"Paddet","publisherHandle":"liam","publisherId":"74154","publisherName":"Liam Martens","viewCount":165171},{"description":"❖ OVERVIEW\nPaddi helps you to set paddings for a Group, a Frame, or a Component. When you specify the padding values in the component name you can change the elements inside the component and apply the paddings in one click. The component will automatically resize itself so that it surrounds all other elements within the component according to padding values.\n\nSpecify the padding values within the component group or frame name. E.g. button [12 24]. The format of the padding values is in the same order as CSS.\n\n❖ FEATURES\n✅ Paddi works with Groups, Frames, Components, Libraries.\n✅ Paddi is simple! The only thing you need to do is specify the paddings in the component name\n✅ Recognize components with paddings looking at their names. ⚡️ It works the same as in CSS.\n✅ Paddi is flexible. No limitation there, set the same padding for all sides [12] or different for each one [12 24 14 32].\n✅ Paddi uses a base element as a parent and calculates paddings from it.\n✅ Speed up your workflow! You don’t need to open plugin settings all the time you need to update paddings. You only need to rename the component and run the Paddi.\n✅ Natural master & instance behavior. If you change master component paddings, you don’t need to do anything else to update instances, Paddi will update all instances automatically.\n✅ Paddi works with libraries. Create a master component in your library file and apply the padding for all its instances in any project file. ⚠️ If you change padding for the master component in the library you will have to update all instances in the other files manually.\n\n❖ PADDINGS\nPadding values sets by clockwise from top to left sides. It works the same as in CSS. Examples:\n- [12] - padding for all sides - 12px\n- [12 24] - top&bottom - 12px, right&left - 24 px\n- [12 24 32] - top - 12px, right&left - 24px, bottom - 32px\n- [12 24 32 16] - top - 12px, right - 24px, bottom - 32px, left - 16px\n\n❖ FORMATS\nWe recommend to use space for separating padding values to keep it simple, however, you can use a comma as well. Examples:\n- [12 24]\n- [12, 24, 24, 12]\n\n❖ SET PADDINGS FOR A GROUP\n1. Create a rectangle. This element will be the base of the component\n2. Put some text or another shape inside the rectangle\n3. Group these elements\n4. Select the Group and whether rename the Group by adding e.g. [16 32] at the end of the name or just run Paddi to apply the default values - [12 24]\n5. Change text or resize elements inside the Group\n6. Select the Group and run Paddi again to apply the paddings\n\n❖ SET PADDINGS FOR A FRAME\n1. Write some text or create a shape\n2. Wrap it with a Frame\n3. ⚠️ In case you have only one element in the Frame the paddings will calculate from the Frame to its element. ⚠️ In case you have more than 1 element inside the Frame and want to use this Frame as the base you need to wrap all its elements with a Group\n4. Select the Frame and whether rename the Frame by adding e.g. [16 32] at the end of the name or just run Paddi to apply the default values - [12 24]\n5. Change text or resize elements inside the Frame\n6. Select the Frame and run Paddi again to apply the paddings\n\n❖ SET PADDINGS FOR A COMPONENT\n1. After you have a Group with some paddings create a master component from it\n2. Set constraints for the master component to make sure its instances will responsive correctly. Set Scale for the base and make sure all other elements have Left and Top\n3. Change elements and run Paddi. ⚠️ Because you can’t change elements position in an instance you will be able to change only the text elements and then apply the paddings\n\n❖ IGNORE\nTo ignore some elements in your component, rename the necessary ones with [ignore] or [nopaddi] at the end of its name.\n\n❖ IMPORTANT TO KNOW\n⚠️ The lowest element in a group or frame is going to be the base of the component! So don't forget to add a base.\n⚠️ The base element in your component will be marked as (base) in the layer name.\n⚠️ You can’t change paddings for instance because you can’t change its elements positioning. To handle it, go to the master component or detach the instance.\n⚠️ If you want to set a Frame as a base and specify paddings for it, wrap all elements inside this frame in a group to have only one element in the frame and then apply Paddi.\n\n❖ WHERE TO USE\n✅ Buttons\n✅ Tab items\n✅ Navigation items\n✅ Dropdown menus\n✅ Tags / Pils / Badges\n✅ Tooltips / Popovers\n✅ Icons\n✅ UI Cards\n✅ Modal dialogs\n✅ Sections\n✅ Etc.\n\n❖ SHORTCUT FOR MAC OS\nTo speed up your workflow add a shortcut to Paddi. It takes a minute to set up but keeps a lot of time later on.\nOpen System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts tab -> App Shortcuts -> Add new:\n1. Application: Figma\n2. Menu Title: Paddi\n3. Keyboard shortcut: cmd+shift+P (You can use your own)\n\n---\n\n😎 MADE BY\nOleksandr Telnov & Mikhail Voloshin at Dumka.io","id":"746314565953874339","installCount":3487,"lastUpdateDate":"2019-10-25T10:50:34.888Z","likeCount":29,"name":"Paddi","publisherHandle":"dumkaio","publisherId":"1312969","publisherName":"Oleksandr Telnov","viewCount":60520},{"description":"<p>Set up three types of padding and manage them centrally.</p><p>设置三种 Padding 并集中管理。</p><p><br></p><p>1.

Primary600? That name doesn't mean much. PrimaryButtonLabel? That's clear as can be.\n\nThis plugin makes it simple to maintain a collection of semantically named colors that derive their color from your base palette. Not only does this allow you to increase clarity of usage, it also lays the foundation necessary for theming within your apps. \n\nFor more details on why you should implement your colors this way, read this blog post:\nhttps://dev.to/ynab/a-semantic-color-system-the-theory-hk7\n\nUsing Semantic Color Sync is simple. First, create your base palette. For each base palette color, add a consistent prefix, such as “.palette/”\n\nNext, create a series of semantically named colors. In the description for each semantically named color, add the base palette color it derives from (including the prefix). For example: “.palette/primary600”\n\nNext, when you decide to change your primary hue from blue to bright pink (good choice, btw), the Semantic Color Sync plugin will automatically search through every semantically named color and update their color to match the updates made in your base palette. \n\nNo need to update things by hand... Ugh. Just tweak your base palette and run this plugin to propagate the changes throughout all of your semantically named colors!\n\nAnd again, if you’re curious why this is useful, this blog post has it all laid out: \nhttps://dev.to/ynab/a-semantic-color-system-the-theory-hk7","id":"748971588750337968","installCount":683,"lastUpdateDate":"2020-02-27T18:44:48.679Z","likeCount":44,"name":"Semantic Color Sync","publisherHandle":"YNAB","publisherId":"1890","publisherName":"You Need A Budget","viewCount":42073},{"description":"If you prefer to keep your components on a separate page and are tired of carrying them manually, this plugin is for you.\n\n1.

The places occupied by the components will be substituted by their instances.\n\nThe plugin has two independent commands to choose from:\n\nSend to components page\n(For a quick search, print snc)\n\nWhen this command is invoked, the Components are sent to a separate page while staying on the same page.\n\nSend to components page and go to\n(for a quick search, print sngo)\n\nWhen this command is invoked, after moving components the focus is moved to the components page, and all newly transferred components are selected.\n\nAll components are placed in a special frame only for predictability, and you are welcome to extract the characters from the frame and organize them as you wish. See it as a predictable arrival point for new components.\n\nAlthough the presence of components in the frame will not prevent further calls (i.e. you can securely call the plugin several times in a row), the plugin looks up at the contents of the frame every time, so for better performance, it makes sense to keep it as empty as possible.\n\nA few details:\n\n- If you already have a page named \"Components\" or \"Symbols\", the plugin will use it to place its frame.

You'll need to acquire your own free API key here: https://ocr.space/OCRAPI#free\n* Copy your API key and paste it into the plugin.\n* Once your key is saved, select a layer with a static image as a fill, and run the plugin\n* After a brief delay, the text will be copied to your clipboard, ready to be pasted.\n\nLIMITATIONS\n* You can only select one layer at a time currently\n* If an image has more than one image fill, it will only work for the top one\n* As a quirk of how the plugin was made, you will briefly see a non-interactive window pop up. This allows for content to be added to your clipboard.\n* In addition, the same limitations that apply to OCR.Space's API free tier applies obviously to this plugin, such as file size limit, and rate limiting.

This plugin will do it for you!\n\nThis plugin will let you do this:\n\n1. Manage style references on a selected node\n2. Auto-update all references as you change origins (keep the plugin open for this)\n3. Export references to make it available for third-party consumers\n4. Switch contexts\n\n# 1. Manage References\n\nSelect a node for which you want to manage references, eg. a rectangle. Open the \"Style References\" plugin and a dialog will appear that let you do it. Currently these styles are supported:\n\n- Fill Style\n- Stroke Style\n- Effect Style\n\nFor each of those there is a section in the dialog where you can manage the origin style to the reference.\n\n- **Origin** That's the _original_ style.\n- **Reference** That's the style to which the origin is copied over when references are updated.\n\n## Transforms\n\nFor paint styles (Fill and Stroke) transforms are available. When styles\nare referenced from origin to reference you can put transforms in between.\nAvailabe are HSL + Opacity values. They will be applied during\nreferencing.\n\nUse this to automate your color palette. Make one color swatch for your\nbase value (e.g. \"Brand / 500\"). A darker color would take your base value as\nreference and set lightness to \"-20\" - name it for example \"Brand / 300\".\n\n# 2. Export\n\nYou can export your references to jsonbin.io and by that make it available for third-party consumers, e.g. if you want to update your design tokens in your code. Here is how:\n\nEnter credentials in settngs:\n\n1. Create an account and copy the API Key\n2. Create a bin and copy the bin URL\n\nOn the tools tab the `Export Settings` button becomes available. Clicking the button will export your references.\n\n# 3. Import\n\nYou can import your earlier exported references from jsonbin.io. That is really helpful when you duplicated your document - figma will not copy over your stored references. Here is how to import references:\n\n1. Duplicate a document\n2. Open the old document, open the plugin, go to settings and copy the Bin URL\n3. Go the new new document (the plugin should still be opened), paste the URL into the input for import and click the button next to it.\n4. A notification will appear telling you how much references were imported.\n5. You can work with your new document the same way as the old one now - win!\n\n# 4. Contexts\n\nContexts are a lightweight way to organize various theme modes within one document. E.g. if you have light and dark mode in one document, you may want to give styles for respective styles a specific suffix, e.g. `.$dark` - With defined contexts, you can swap between them quickly and then use Themer to export them.\n\n## Workflow Suggestion\n\nUse it in combination with Themer:\n\n1. Set your variants for each context (`§light` and `§dark`)\n2. Select a context\n3. Use `Style References` to map those \"compiled\" styles\n4. Use `Themer` to export and apply them\n\n### Things to Know\n\n- When setting the origin style the suggestions only show local styles, that is also due to limitations of the current figma API, given security reasons for shared team libraries. That's fair - figma keeps us safe, give them credit for that :)\n\nIt still is possible to use library styles, then you can't use the style references manage dialog, instead manually assign those style and THEN use the style references dialog in order to persist it.\n\n- Once you have one node \"under management\", you may want to change the local style but once you update references, those new ones will be overridden. Re-select the node again and the references dialog will provide you options for migrating styles, to either keep the old one or use the new one.\n\n- Once you link origin to reference the node itself will show the reference as its local style, which might give you wonders, yet is expected and the correct behavior.","id":"791262205400516364","installCount":923,"lastUpdateDate":"2020-06-07T12:13:14.648Z","likeCount":30,"name":"Theemo - Style Automator","publisherHandle":"gossi","publisherId":"891","publisherName":"Thomas Gossmann","viewCount":60569},{"description":"<p>Are you looking for a plugin that lets you quickly switch between multi-branded style sheets, improves your workflow, and reduces work-time by 25%?

When you have multiple themes, Themer will swap styles that match across themes: which means you need two styles with the same names in each theme.\n\nIn order for Themer to be used across your team, generic information about your styles is shared on a external service (jsonbin.io). You will need an account with an API key to get started (You can easily sign in with Google, GutHub or Twitter).\n\nWatch the setup video on YouTube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM8SkksBy3Y&feature=youtu.be\n\n1. Insert your API key from JSONbin\n\n2. Create your first theme, giving it a unique name, and then choose where you want to pull the styles from (all local styles, styles used on the page, or a selection).\n\n*Tip*: If all of your styles exist within one document, you can also prefix your style names with 'theme1/' or 'theme2/' and set Themer to generate multiuple themes at once.\n\n3. With your themes created, you can now apply them to a selection or the entire page. Remember, your design must make use of the same styles from one of the themes to work.\n\nPrivacy:\nThemer stores information about your styles at a service external to Figma. For each theme, we store the name of the theme, the name of the style, the type of style (color, text, effect), and a unique key required to import your styles into a document from your team library. No other data from your file is sent to Jsonbin.

Generate this token from your Transifex account under User Settings =&gt; API token. After generating the token, copy and paste it in the related input box in the Figma plugin and click “Connect”.</p><p><br></p><p>You should complete the following plugin settings after connecting with Transifex:</p><p>Organization: the desired organization to work with.</p><p>Project: the desired project that these Figma strings will be associated with.</p><p>Resource: the desired resource of the selected project to push strings to. If you don’t have any resources you can try to create one using the action “Create a new resource” (note that you should have the adequate permissions in order to perform this action).</p><p><br></p><p>After setting the options, click “Save”.</p><p><br></p><p>Using the plugin</p><p><br></p><p>1. Start selecting the Figma layers that you want to send, or “push”, to your Transifex resource for translation.</p><p>2. Your selection will collect your text layers as strings in the main window of the plugin, under both the “Push strings to Transifex” and “Pull strings from Transifex” tabs.</p><p>3. To remove any unwanted strings from the selection in the “Push” or “Pull” tabs, click the X to the right of the string. That string will be removed from the current selection list.</p><p>4. Click the “Push” button to send the selected strings to Transifex and add them to the connected resource. After pushing the strings you can check to see that they were successfully sent using the “View resource in Transifex” link. Also you have the option to upload screenshots if you have selected “Upload Screenshots”. The strings will be translated according to the workflow set up in the Transifex project.</p><p>5. By default the plugin will automatically generate screenshots of your Figma frames and include them with the pushed strings in Transifex. The strings for translation will be automatically mapped to the screenshots in Transifex to provide visual context of your Figma designs to your translators and ensure the quality of the translation. Optionally you can disable screenshot generation for any string push by deselecting the “Upload Screenshots” checkbox in the “Push Strings to Transifex” tab.</p><p>6. You can use the “Replace Resource Strings” feature to clean extra or outdated strings out of your Transifex resources. if this option is checked when you click the “Push” button to send strings to Transifex, then all of the strings currently in the connected resource will be purged and replaced with the current selection only. This option should be used carefully, especially with resources shared by other users. If you are sure you want to replace all the strings in the resource with the current selection, click “OK” in the confirmation dialog. The resource strings will be replaced, and the “Replace” option will be reset to deactivated. All of your previous translations remain in the translation memory (TM) so you and your team can reuse them, unless they are also deleted from the TM in Transifex.</p><p>7. To pull translations back from Transifex to Figma, first select the Figma layers you want to get translations for and then click the “Pull” button in the “Pull Strings from Transifex” tab. You have the option to pull them in all languages or in a specific one by selecting it in the “Language” dropdown. The pull operation will create a new page in your Figma file for every language with the same name of the selected page and the language code as prefix, and automatically insert translations for the selected strings.</p><p><br></p><p>About Transifex</p><p>Founded in Greece and now headquartered in Silicon Valley, Transifex helps companies - from Startups to the Enterprise - go global.
