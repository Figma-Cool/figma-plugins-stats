This plugin allows you to effortlessly pull text and images from an Airtable database and inject them straight into your Figma components. Using the plugin is child’s play. First, you build your component in Figma, business as usual. Then, you load up the Airtable 2 Figma plugin, and map the Airtable data fields to the right layers in Figma. Finally, choose the layout you want your component to be laid out as and voilà, you just saved yourself a couple hundred clicks! You now have a nice set of data directly inserted  into your designs. Find out more at: https://figma.bothrs.com\n\nTake a gander at the data types we can import directly from Airtable into Figma:\n\n1. Single line text\n2. Long text\n3. Phone number\n4. Email\n5. Numeric\n6. Image\n\nHere’s a sample database (about cats) for you to experiment with: https://airtable.com/shr0hyEnBae0AKKfQ\n\nNext, follow these steps, or watch a tutorial video over at https://figma.bothrs.com\n\n1. Go to https://airtable.com  and build or select your own table\n2. In your Airtable of choice, click ‘Share’\n3. Scroll down and click ‘Create a shared view’\n4. Click ‘Share the current view’\n5. Next, click ‘Create a shareable grid view’.\n6. Then, copy the link and paste it in the plugin window.\n7. Assign Airtable columns to text nodes or images.\n8.

For flexibility the formatting is done using js code where you can use $value as the variable coming from the JSON. Here are a few examples:\n- John-follower -> $value.split('-')[0] -> John\n- 224.50 ->  '€ ' + Math.round($value) -> € 225\n- true -> $value ? 'available' : 'occupied' -> available\n- 1 -> ['Clear', 'Rain', 'Snow'][$value] -> Rain\n- 1988 -> \"'\" + ($value).toString().substring(2,4) -> '88\n- klm -> `https://airlines/${$value}.png` -> https://airlines/klm.png\n\nAPI Request Options\nIn the case you need to add request options to your API call, you can do so in a separate field and provide the options as an object.

Not happy with your confetti or bar graph? Just. Keep. Randomizing!\n\nYou've got three methods of randomization to choose from, per property!\n\n- \"Range\" is handy for randomizing bars in a graph, for example, allowing you to constrain height between a min and max\n\n- \"List\" is handy for making confetti, for example, by letting you randomize the fillColor of your selected elements, but keeping them within your chosen palette.\n\n- \"Calc\" does multiplication or addition rather than just picking numbers out of the air. Consider slowly growing bubbles by multiplying their width and height by 1.1–1.5x. Just keep randomizing and they'll keep growing slightly until you're happy with the results.\n\nFor each type, you have the option to apply the randomized values in a sorted order. Consider making a bar graph, but you want to show profits getting bigger and bigger. Generate as many as you like until you're happy, in mere seconds!\n\nNote: If you try to randomize a property that's unsupported by the elements in your selection (\"strokeColor\" on elements without a stroke applied already), that property will simply be skipped; supported properties will still be randomized.\n\nFeedback would be very much appreciated.

Simply save color styles as you normally do and Color Theme Manager can help you with the rest. No need to worry about JSON, naming prefix, selection, etc. Good for developing color systems, projects require multiple color themes (like dark mode and light mode), and giving your design a new look.\n\nFeatures\n\nSave Color Theme\nCarefully name your current color theme and it will be saved within the Figma file you are working with. This will save all local color styles into a color theme. Note color styles in color themes will not update when you modified local color styles, you need to manually save changes to color themes.\n\nApply Color Theme\nChange to an entirely different look by applying a color theme with only one click. Your local color styles will be replaced by ones from the color theme you choose.\n\n Import/Export Color Themes\nDue to the current Figma Plugin API limitation, transferring data across Figma file can not be streamlined. A second-best solution is offered by Color Theme Manager, simply copy your saved color theme into clipboard and paste to another file.\n\nHow?\n\nColor Theme Manager will look for color style from a saved theme with the exact same name and replace the local style. So name your color styles (and color themes) wisely. Repeated names will cause unexpected results.\n\nFuture\n\n- Features like auto update, read/write to libraries can not be implemented efficiently with the current set of APIs. This might change when new APIs come out.\n- Color styles involve image fill is not implemented very efficiently.

This is because the plugin has to search all of the nodes in the current document for components.\n2. Team libraries are stored by name, so if you have 2 team libraries called \"Design System\", saving one will overwrite the other in this plugin.\n3. Saved team libraries do not persist if browser cache has been cleared.

It does this by taking a sampling of colors from the area directly behind the element and calculating the contrast ratio for each color. Contrast considers a color passing if all colors in the sample pass.\n\nBugs\n\nIf you have a situation where Contrast is not finding the right background, please let us know! Send us an example test case in Figma along with a short description of what you were expecting, and we’ll have a look.\n\nKnown Issues\n\n* Element strokes are not yet supported\n\nSmart Sampling Technique\n\nContrast uses RGBQuant to analyze the selection of pixels behind an element. It looks for colors (pixels) that are represented two or more times within each sub-region (64x64) of the area tested. This method gives the best balance of speed and results. The time it takes Contrast to sample and analyze the colors is proportional to the size of the layer you are testing. I.e., Larger layers, in terms of area, will take longer than smaller areas. Sampling can temporarily block the interface in the same way that exporting a frame might—this shouldn’t be very noticeable for smaller layers.\n\nCredits\n\nContrast was made by the Maark design team.","lastUpdateDate":"2020-05-01T21:16:41.627Z","tags":[null],"publisherHandle":"alex","publisherId":"1032443","publisherName":"Alex Carr","installCount":27726,"likeCount":344,"viewCount":767249},{"id":"872488431206658813","name":"Contrast","description":"<p>Contrast is the new way to inspect, collaborate, and build components from Figma designs.

Crowdin is a cloud-based localization solution that speeds up and automates translation. Crowdin helps tech companies localize their apps, websites, games, marketing content, and more. As a company-wide solution, it is the place where all teams involved can collaborate and manage the multilingual content together.\n\nWith Crowdin plugin you can\n- Quickly generate multi-language creative assets.\n- Customize the translated copies and fix inconsistencies before the programming starts.\n- Add to your mockups source texts already uploaded to the Crowdin project by other teams.\n- Upload tagged screenshots to your Crowdin project for translators’ reference.\n\nCrowdin and Figma integration works both ways, and the plugin has 2 modes – Page Translation and Crowdin Strings.\n\nPage Translation Mode – Test Designs Before Development\n\nThis mode helps to send texts to Crowdin with the context for translators in a click and upload translations back to Figma. Use this mode to quickly generate multi-language creative assets, like brochures, stickers, and more. As well as preview and customize translated designs before mockups go to development.\n\nIn Crowdin, you can apply different approaches to get the content translated:\n- Pre-translate texts via Machine Translation engines.\n- Invite in-house translators.\n- Hire a professional translation agency.\n- Engage your community in the translation process.\n\nWorking on the texts on Crowdin, translators get design previews as they are on Figma, along with other localization resources like Translation Memories, Glossaries, and more. \n\nCrowdin Strings Mode – Get Source Texts and Upload Screenshots\n\nCrowdin Strings mode allows you to get source texts that are already uploaded to the Crowdin project by other teams and add them to your designs in a click. Great for teams that start localization right from the start and helps to use real texts instead of ‘Lorem Ipsum’ in the designs you create.\n\nWorking in this mode, you can also automatically upload tagged screenshots of the frames where you used the source texts. Screenshots are visible for translators in the Crowdin Editor (a place where all translations happen) and will give more context.\n\nHow to Set Up\n\nTo get started, you will need a Crowdin account and a localization project under it. You can create a new project, or ask for manager access to the existing one. Sign up at https://accounts.crowdin.com/register \n\nIf you manage a project in Crowdin yourself after a 14-day free trial, select one of the subscription plans at https://crowdin.com/pricing#annual.\n\nTo connect Figma and Crowdin accounts:\n\n1. Install Crowdin for Figma Plugin.\n2. Open the necessary Figma file.\n3. Head to the menu in the top-left corner and select Plugins > Crowdin.\n4. Provide Personal Access Token. You can generate it in your Account Settings in Crowdin. \n5.

Import a shared template by entering the key and pressing plus icon, try it with key “bootstrap” (without quotes).\n\nResizing the plugin window:\nYou can resize the window of the plugin by pressing Cmd/Ctrl + Arrow keys when the plugin window is in focus (click anywhere in the window if resize is not working) — similar to how you can resize objects in Figma.\n\nKnown issues:\n• All templates are currently saved locally to your Figma app or browser. If you clear the browser cache, reinstall the app or log out of Figma, your templates may be lost.\n• You cannot reoder groups or templates yet. I may add this functionality in the future if there are enough requests.","lastUpdateDate":"2020-04-23T02:30:05.350Z","tags":[null],"publisherHandle":"g","publisherId":"328","publisherName":"Gleb","installCount":764,"likeCount":59,"viewCount":40368},{"id":"834062945643616879","name":"Dark Mode Magic","description":"Transform your design into Dark mode\n\nThe plugin automatically generates colors for Dark mode from a light palette and applys them to elements\n\n 1.

E.g. for { “data\": [ object1, object2, …, objectN ] }, write {name.first} instead of {data.name.first}\n\nPopulating text\n\n  •  Populate an entire text layer by renaming the layer. \n  •  Alternatively populate a part of a text layer by adding your curly brackets within the text (e.g. “I love {location.city}” becomes “I love New York”). \n  •  The plugin remembers the parts it populated, so you can populate the same layers again and again.\n\nPopulating images\n\n  •  Populate images by renaming a shape layer. \n  •  The data source for images must be a URL to a hosted image.\n  •  Try https://source.unsplash.com/ for easy hosted images.\n\nPopulating a component/instance\n\n  •  When you select a bunch of regular layers, the plugin randomly chooses the records to populate them with.

Select one or more layers in Figma that contain image fills. \n1.

Command + Shift + P to re-run\n\nHow does Smart Populate work?\n- If you selected one or more frames which contain an image, shapes, and text, the plugin will use the first image it finds to automatically fill the shapes with the computed dominant color and set text layers to have a high-contrast fill against that dominant color.\n- If you selected an image along with shapes and text layers, the plugin will use the selected image to populate selected shapes with the computed dominant color and set text layers to use the high-contrast fill color.\n- If you selected shapes and text, but no image, the plugin will traverse outwards in your frame until it finds an image fill. This image will will then be used to populate the shapes and text with the dominant color and high-contrast text colors.\n\nNote: This plugin supports both image fills and background fills, using the first valid fill it can find. As a result, a frame with a background fill that has children shape and text layers will populate successfully!\n\nSecret options: If you'd like to text layers to the dominant color rather than high-contrast color, simply include the text \"dominant\" anywhere in the layer name!\n \nThis plugin is open source, contributions welcome: https://github.com/brianlovin/figma-dominant-color-toolkit\n\nCredits\n\ncolor-thief (https://github.com/lokesh/color-thief) for finding dominant colors and generating palettes","lastUpdateDate":"2019-08-23T14:56:22.880Z","tags":[null],"publisherHandle":"brian","publisherId":"22538","publisherName":"Brian Lovin","installCount":6403,"likeCount":52,"viewCount":55962},{"id":"750133948866339898","name":"Doodlebug","description":"Share your mockups directly to Chrome so developers have a pixel-perfect visual reference to build from.\n\n** How it works **\n\n1.

This is done to maintain spacing for when the height of an element has changed in the instance, i.e. if you have text change from 1 line to 2. \n\nRequirements:\n\nMaster components are required to have a frame, the plugin looks for this. Within the frame you must have 2 elements; these are the ones that you'll fill up with content and will change from instance to instance. This usually is a \"header\" and \"body copy\" (see artwork picture above). \n\nThe frame must have the following settings:\n- Either contrained \"top and bottom\" or \"scale\" (vertical) \n\nThe top element must have the following settings:\n- Constrained to the top\n- Grow vertically (for text)\n- Align top (for text)\n\nThe bottom element must have the following settings:\n-  Contrained to the bottom\n- Grow vertically (for text)\n- Align bottom (for text)\n\nIf you've done this setup, open up the plugin modal, select the element or elements you want to resize and click \"run\". \n\nThe plugin will run it's magic. It will maintain the space between the two elements within the frame (in the example in the artwork, 20px). If you want to change the spacing, adjust the master, then select the elements and return the plugin. \n\nI will create an automatic resizer when figma allows for long lasting plugins. \n\nAny other feedback, feel free to email me at daniel_maddock@intuit.com","lastUpdateDate":"2019-08-13T17:04:30.561Z","tags":[null],"publisherHandle":"1458460","publisherId":"1458460","publisherName":"Daniel Maddock","installCount":3148,"likeCount":13,"viewCount":25172},{"id":"781591244449826498","name":"Easing Gradient","description":"Linear gradients often have hard edges where they start and/or end.\nThis plugin adds gradient stops to approximate easing functions.\n\nRoadmap:\n- Easing function selection\n- Custom bezier curve editor\n- Custom color step input\n- Color space selection","lastUpdateDate":"2019-11-29T04:42:55.627Z","tags":[null],"publisherHandle":"matchai","publisherId":"27706","publisherName":"Matan Kushner","installCount":3902,"likeCount":66,"viewCount":54183},{"id":"750743440401413268","name":"Easometric","description":"With Easometric it is really easy to create isometric layers & groups.\n\nThis plugin using SSR30⁰, which is the most popular and flexible method of creating isometric artworks.

A few highlights:\n\n- Supports constraints and auto-layout.\n- Translates blend modes.\n- Adapts border styles including centered borders.\n- Handles filter effects like background blur and layer blur.\n- Preserves affine transformations like scales and rotations.\n- Handles all fill types including linear and radial gradients and images.\n- Imports vector and compound shapes as SVGs.\n- Mirrors the original hierarchical structure.\n- Carries over most type styles.\n\nOnce in Plasmic, the design could immediately be published as a standalone static website in CodeSandbox or your own codebase. But you will often also want to refactor the design into a more hygienic and lasting structure, suitable for production and for integrating with code. That’s where the rest of Plasmic’s toolset comes in, letting you take advantage of the richer layout, component structure (variants/slots), interactions, style abstractions (mixins/tokens), and element types (such as form elements) for functionality and accessibility. Plasmic’s core philosophy is to enable you to incrementally refine the messy and exploratory into the clean and robust.\n\nFollow https://twitter.com/plasmicapp for the latest updates.","lastUpdateDate":"2020-08-04T06:48:10.958Z","tags":[null],"publisherHandle":"99950f08_2df5_4","publisherId":"843254771306409369","publisherName":"Plasmic","installCount":418,"likeCount":22,"viewCount":27685},{"id":"777979912214797531","name":"Figmass","description":"Figmass plugin can take your SASS files with CSS rules and creates the same styles in Figma.

All of us have encountered cases where we need to add something to a component but don’t want that to show up in all the hundreds and thousands of existing instances. We finally end up creating a new component so that the existing work is not affected. This plugin solves this issue with a single click.\n\nFollow these steps to hide a particular layer from all component instances\n• Select the layer/group/frame that you want to hide from one of the instances of a component\n• Select Hide Layers from Instances -> Hide\n• The selected layer/group/frame will be hidden from all instances in the current page\n\nUse the Force Hide option if the layer that you want to hide is part of a component that is nested in multiple other components and you want to hide the layer in all of them at once.\nEg.: If you want to hide a layer in an icon component that is already used in various other components like different state and sizes of buttons, then Hide option will just hide the layer in the selected state or size of the button. Whereas Force Hide will hide the layer in all the instances of all the components that this icon is used.\n\nThis plugin works only on instances and not on components\nCAUTION: When using the Force Hide option. ensure that the name of the layer you are hiding is unique. If not, multiple layers may get hidden.\n\nFeels too small a feature for a plugin?

No exports, copying and pasting files, no code cleaning or additional optimizations. \n\nFor developers: Imagine that you receive a bunch of icons from your fellow designer. You have to extract needed data from all those SVG files... It's time consuming... Forget about it. Now you can easily export all icons data to a JSON file with one click! If you have a custom Icon component in React, Angular or Vue — that's all you need.\n\nHow it works:\n1. Create frames / components / instances with unique names (plugin seeks for every frame / components / instances in a current page)\n2. Draw icons or paste them from your favorite tool (like IconJar)\n3. Flatten them (if they are not already)\n4. Use the plugin to create a JSON with needed data\n5.

Our design team has been slowly pulling our color libraries into Figma, and early on in the process, we realized this was a long and tedious task. Because the color themes for the products we work on can be quite extensive, manually creating color styles and a visual color guide takes a lot of time. We decided that Microsoft's Hackathon 2019 would be an excellent opportunity to team up and try and fix this problem. Over the course of three days, we built Kaleidocode to address the gap in our workflow and improve the design process not only for our team but anyone else designing for VS Code.\n\nKaleidocode's creators are Kaitlin Wilkinson, Miguel Solorio, and Pine Wu.","lastUpdateDate":"2019-08-02T23:58:07.001Z","tags":[null],"publisherHandle":"microsoft","publisherId":"1500","publisherName":"Microsoft","installCount":3176,"likeCount":29,"viewCount":43428},{"id":"731316515732442555","name":"Keyboard Scrolling","description":"Scroll around a Figma document using your keyboard arrow keys. \n\nWhile zooming in and out of a Figma page is possible via a mouse / trackpad or keyboard shortcuts, the ability to scroll and pan around a Figma page is currently constrained to mouse / trackpad interactions and therefore somewhat inaccessible to users who don't use a mouse / trackpad input.","lastUpdateDate":"2019-08-07T15:22:59.858Z","tags":[null],"publisherHandle":"Tiffany","publisherId":"668480","publisherName":"Tiffany Chen","installCount":86,"likeCount":2,"viewCount":1797},{"id":"829240879167560536","name":"Khoj","description":"Want to find and navigate to the artboards of your choice and see your recent searches?

Use the Figma plugin to quickly include translated content in your designs without going back and forth with product managers, translators and developers. \n\nThis Figma plugin allows you to:\n\n- Push texts from Figma to Lokalise\n- Set key names (unique identifiers that are used for representing text in code and your design) or use any of the patterns for automatic naming \n- Match Figma texts to existing Lokalise keys (and existing translations)\n- Pull translated texts from Lokalise to Figma\n- Seamlessly switch languages in Figma and check if your design works in other languages\n \nLaunch the plugin\n\n1. Open your Figma project\n2. Go to the Plugins section and choose Lokalise\n3. Connect your Lokalise account\n4. Allow Figma to access your Lokalise workspace.\n5. Go back to Figma and select one of the existing Lokalise projects or create a new one. You can also set the default key naming pattern and the default platform for the newly created keys (this applies to the keys this Figma plugin will create in Lokalise).\n6. Click Finish Setup.\n\nWhen the setup is complete. Start using the plugin by pushing your Figma strings to the Lokalise project so translators can start working on them right away. \n\nFor more information (with screenshots) check out the detailed documentation page\nhttps://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/3732824-figma\n\nThis plugin requires a paid Lokalise account (14-day free trial).","lastUpdateDate":"2020-08-13T11:00:54.094Z","tags":[null],"publisherHandle":"0a1c6df9_419a_4","publisherId":"870953351105553343","publisherName":"Lokalise","installCount":1400,"likeCount":35,"viewCount":39946},{"id":"754418010908848797","name":"Looper","description":"A Figma plugin for creating trippy generated graphics.

Compare instances to their default main component and copy and paste the overrides.\n\nFeatures\n1. Copy and paste overrides between symbols\n\nTwo of Figma's greatest strengths are:\n\na. Overriding colors, text, and other properties on component instances, and \nb. Swapping out instances of components, such as a icons or states.\n\nBut when you swap an instance, you lose all the overrides you've made, including changes to nested instances within a parent component.\n\nMaximum Override allows you to copy your overrides, swap out an instance, and then paste the overrides back onto the new instance, to retain all of your changes. This includes nested instances that you've swapped with a different component.\n\n2. Compare properties between objects\n\nMaximum Override also allows you to select any two nodes on the stage and compare them against each other to see what's different. (In software, this is known as a \"diff\".) You can then copy the changes from object A to object B, or vice-versa. If you select a single instance, Maximum Override will compare it against its own main component.\n\n------------\n\nBugs? Suggestions? Contributions?

Just select anything you would like to \"neumorph\", open the plugin and boom. It adds shadows and gradient fills to your selection, which you can customize to your needs.\n\nWhat is neumorphism?\n\nIt's a UI trend which is using multiple shadows and gradients to \"fake\" light and to bring back a more natural and realistic look and feel. Kind of like skeuomorphism in iOS back in 2007. Read more about it here: https://uxdesign.cc/neumorphism-in-user-interfaces-b47cef3bf3a6\n\n—\n\nA few tips how to create beautiful neumorphic designs:\n\n- The background layer and the layer you are \"neumorphing\" should have the same color.\n\n- If you neumorph' text, be sure to also have it the same color, open the plugin, and when you're done, you can change the text color to a darker one, for better readability. \n\n- Neumorphism doesn't work on pure white or pure black, because it adds shadows that are darker / brighter than the background/current selection fill. If you use pure white or black, it will miss one of the shadows and it won't feel \"neumorphistic\" anymore. I'll suggest to take a kind of bluish tint of white / black.\n\n—\n\nThank you very much for the kind help for the color calculation-algorithm from Adam, he built the site https://neumorphism.io/ on which you can generate neumorphic CSS shadows.

A few options will also be available to you to optimize how Paddet updates your paddings. The last used settings are saved for each frame so you can easily let paddy automagically update your paddings on the fly without having to check your settings again.\n\nFAQ\n* Can I use it on component instances?\nYes you can! Do keep in mind it will firstly apply the padding to your master component and update the selected instances afterwards. Another important note to mention is that whenever your master component updates all your instances will be affected as well, however paddy will not automatically update your instances for their respective content. If this is something you want you need to use the :paddet-autoupdate flag on the instance name\n\n* What does the :paddet-autoupdate flag do in the name of an instance?\nIf a component instance has this flag in it's name Paddet wil update the instance for it's content whenever Paddet is used on the master component.\n\n* What does using :paddet-ignore in my layer name do?\nThis flag will ensure Paddet does not take into account that layer when it is calculating the width and height of the current content. This is especially useful when you have a seperate layer for your background as you do not want this layer to be taken into account as actual content.\n\n* What does using :paddet-resize in my layer name do?\nUsing the resize flag will tell Paddet to resize it along with your frame.  As with the ignore flag, this is useful when you have a background layer.\n\n* Can I combine the ignore and resize flags?\nYes you can.\n\n* Will Paddet remember my settings?\nYes, whenever you update a frame with Paddet it will save your last used settings for that specific frame. This way you can use the \"Auto update padding\" option to easily re-update your paddings without having to open the complete plugin.","lastUpdateDate":"2019-08-24T10:08:58.118Z","tags":[null],"publisherHandle":"liam","publisherId":"74154","publisherName":"Liam Martens","installCount":9692,"likeCount":30,"viewCount":69062},{"id":"746314565953874339","name":"Paddi","description":"❖ OVERVIEW\nPaddi helps you to set paddings for a Group, a Frame, or a Component. When you specify the padding values in the component name you can change the elements inside the component and apply the paddings in one click. The component will automatically resize itself so that it surrounds all other elements within the component according to padding values.\n\nSpecify the padding values within the component group or frame name. E.g. button [12 24]. The format of the padding values is in the same order as CSS.\n\n❖ FEATURES\n✅ Paddi works with Groups, Frames, Components, Libraries.\n✅ Paddi is simple! The only thing you need to do is specify the paddings in the component name\n✅ Recognize components with paddings looking at their names. ⚡️ It works the same as in CSS.\n✅ Paddi is flexible. No limitation there, set the same padding for all sides [12] or different for each one [12 24 14 32].\n✅ Paddi uses a base element as a parent and calculates paddings from it.\n✅ Speed up your workflow! You don’t need to open plugin settings all the time you need to update paddings. You only need to rename the component and run the Paddi.\n✅ Natural master & instance behavior. If you change master component paddings, you don’t need to do anything else to update instances, Paddi will update all instances automatically.\n✅ Paddi works with libraries. Create a master component in your library file and apply the padding for all its instances in any project file. ⚠️ If you change padding for the master component in the library you will have to update all instances in the other files manually.\n\n❖ PADDINGS\nPadding values sets by clockwise from top to left sides. It works the same as in CSS. Examples:\n- [12] - padding for all sides - 12px\n- [12 24] - top&bottom - 12px, right&left - 24 px\n- [12 24 32] - top - 12px, right&left - 24px, bottom - 32px\n- [12 24 32 16] - top - 12px, right - 24px, bottom - 32px, left - 16px\n\n❖ FORMATS\nWe recommend to use space for separating padding values to keep it simple, however, you can use a comma as well. Examples:\n- [12 24]\n- [12, 24, 24, 12]\n\n❖ SET PADDINGS FOR A GROUP\n1. Create a rectangle. This element will be the base of the component\n2. Put some text or another shape inside the rectangle\n3. Group these elements\n4. Select the Group and whether rename the Group by adding e.g. [16 32] at the end of the name or just run Paddi to apply the default values - [12 24]\n5. Change text or resize elements inside the Group\n6. Select the Group and run Paddi again to apply the paddings\n\n❖ SET PADDINGS FOR A FRAME\n1. Write some text or create a shape\n2. Wrap it with a Frame\n3. ⚠️ In case you have only one element in the Frame the paddings will calculate from the Frame to its element. ⚠️ In case you have more than 1 element inside the Frame and want to use this Frame as the base you need to wrap all its elements with a Group\n4. Select the Frame and whether rename the Frame by adding e.g. [16 32] at the end of the name or just run Paddi to apply the default values - [12 24]\n5. Change text or resize elements inside the Frame\n6. Select the Frame and run Paddi again to apply the paddings\n\n❖ SET PADDINGS FOR A COMPONENT\n1. After you have a Group with some paddings create a master component from it\n2. Set constraints for the master component to make sure its instances will responsive correctly. Set Scale for the base and make sure all other elements have Left and Top\n3. Change elements and run Paddi. ⚠️ Because you can’t change elements position in an instance you will be able to change only the text elements and then apply the paddings\n\n❖ IGNORE\nTo ignore some elements in your component, rename the necessary ones with [ignore] or [nopaddi] at the end of its name.\n\n❖ IMPORTANT TO KNOW\n⚠️ The lowest element in a group or frame is going to be the base of the component! So don't forget to add a base.\n⚠️ The base element in your component will be marked as (base) in the layer name.\n⚠️ You can’t change paddings for instance because you can’t change its elements positioning. To handle it, go to the master component or detach the instance.\n⚠️ If you want to set a Frame as a base and specify paddings for it, wrap all elements inside this frame in a group to have only one element in the frame and then apply Paddi.\n\n❖ WHERE TO USE\n✅ Buttons\n✅ Tab items\n✅ Navigation items\n✅ Dropdown menus\n✅ Tags / Pils / Badges\n✅ Tooltips / Popovers\n✅ Icons\n✅ UI Cards\n✅ Modal dialogs\n✅ Sections\n✅ Etc.\n\n❖ SHORTCUT FOR MAC OS\nTo speed up your workflow add a shortcut to Paddi. It takes a minute to set up but keeps a lot of time later on.\nOpen System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts tab -> App Shortcuts -> Add new:\n1. Application: Figma\n2. Menu Title: Paddi\n3. Keyboard shortcut: cmd+shift+P (You can use your own)\n\n---\n\n😎 MADE BY\nOleksandr Telnov & Mikhail Voloshin at Dumka.io","lastUpdateDate":"2019-10-25T10:50:34.888Z","tags":[null],"publisherHandle":"dumkaio","publisherId":"1312969","publisherName":"Oleksandr Telnov","installCount":3065,"likeCount":24,"viewCount":29690},{"id":"841201477778898873","name":"Page Automator","description":"\"Tired to manually add new page one by one when starting new project in Figma?\"\n\nPage Automator will help you solve this by automate creating multiple pages in just one click.\n\n• Make your own page automator.\nMake your own page automator with providing list of pages.

But the people involved often struggle to be on the same page. UX copy shouldn’t be left for last, and neither should translating it into multiple languages.\n\nPhrase is a Translation Management Solution with the whole team in mind. It’s a cloud-based platform that enables Designers, Copywriters, Product Managers, Developers and Translators to come together to create the best local user experience for global digital products.\nFor more information please visit: https://phrase.com/\n\nWhy Phrase and Figma?\n\nFinally, you can build a bridge between Product Design and Translation teams by syncing texts between Figma and Phrase. Send design content from within Figma to Phrase in seconds so that your Translators can then start their work right away.\n\nLet our plugin inform you when translations are ready so you can pull translated copy into Figma. Preview your designs in all your languages before handoff to Developers.\n\nGive Translators proper context with automatically attached screenshots. Our plugin highlights exactly where each text element belongs. Increase your overall translation quality and reduce feedback loops.\n\nHow to set up\n\nInitially, you need to connect Figma with Phrase.

Primary600? That name doesn't mean much. PrimaryButtonLabel? That's clear as can be.\n\nThis plugin makes it simple to maintain a collection of semantically named colors that derive their color from your base palette. Not only does this allow you to increase clarity of usage, it also lays the foundation necessary for theming within your apps. \n\nFor more details on why you should implement your colors this way, read this blog post:\nhttps://dev.to/ynab/a-semantic-color-system-the-theory-hk7\n\nUsing Semantic Color Sync is simple. First, create your base palette. For each base palette color, add a consistent prefix, such as “.palette/”\n\nNext, create a series of semantically named colors. In the description for each semantically named color, add the base palette color it derives from (including the prefix). For example: “.palette/primary600”\n\nNext, when you decide to change your primary hue from blue to bright pink (good choice, btw), the Semantic Color Sync plugin will automatically search through every semantically named color and update their color to match the updates made in your base palette. \n\nNo need to update things by hand... Ugh. Just tweak your base palette and run this plugin to propagate the changes throughout all of your semantically named colors!\n\nAnd again, if you’re curious why this is useful, this blog post has it all laid out: \nhttps://dev.to/ynab/a-semantic-color-system-the-theory-hk7","lastUpdateDate":"2020-02-27T18:44:48.679Z","tags":[null],"publisherHandle":"YNAB","publisherId":"1890","publisherName":"You Need A Budget","installCount":583,"likeCount":39,"viewCount":21631},{"id":"749061307736645564","name":"Send to Components Page","description":"If you prefer to keep your components on a separate page and are tired of carrying them manually, this plugin is for you.\n\n1.

The places occupied by the components will be substituted by their instances.\n\nThe plugin has two independent commands to choose from:\n\nSend to components page\n(For a quick search, print snc)\n\nWhen this command is invoked, the Components are sent to a separate page while staying on the same page.\n\nSend to components page and go to\n(for a quick search, print sngo)\n\nWhen this command is invoked, after moving components the focus is moved to the components page, and all newly transferred components are selected.\n\nAll components are placed in a special frame only for predictability, and you are welcome to extract the characters from the frame and organize them as you wish. See it as a predictable arrival point for new components.\n\nAlthough the presence of components in the frame will not prevent further calls (i.e. you can securely call the plugin several times in a row), the plugin looks up at the contents of the frame every time, so for better performance, it makes sense to keep it as empty as possible.\n\nA few details:\n\n- If you already have a page named \"Components\" or \"Symbols\", the plugin will use it to place its frame.

In some cases, we have 15px spacing, and in another place, 14px. It's hard always to update all these spacings manually.\n\nWith the help of auto layout, we can resolve this problem. Just turn on the auto layout feature with zero spacing between the elements and use \"spacers\" between.\n\nThere are different ways, but I prefer to use the 8-Point Grid System. You can use premade \"spacers\" from the public library (https://www.figma.com/c/file/809152234949654615/Spacings) and place them between the elements. In that case, you will make sure that the spacings between the components are consistent.\n\nHow it works\nAdd the library https://www.figma.com/c/file/809152234949654615/Spacings or have own symbols that have \"$spacing\" word in the name;\nUse them when needed\nIf you want to hide them, select a parent frame and run the plugin. It will look for all spacers that were used on the frame and will set zero opacity\nIf you want to show spacers back, just rerun the plugin. If the first spacer on the row will have zero opacity, it will set 100% for all spacers found on the selected frame.\n\nPro tip\nYou can use smart spacing prediction feature! Here is how it works https://twitter.com/faridsabitov/status/1281697269948067845\n\nPro tip\nYou can set \"cmd\"+\"option\"+\"H\" hotkey via system preferences in Mac to toggle spacers visibility quickly.

You'll need to acquire your own free API key here: https://ocr.space/OCRAPI#free\n* Copy your API key and paste it into the plugin.\n* Once your key is saved, select a layer with a static image as a fill, and run the plugin\n* After a brief delay, the text will be copied to your clipboard, ready to be pasted.\n\nLIMITATIONS\n* You can only select one layer at a time currently\n* If an image has more than one image fill, it will only work for the top one\n* As a quirk of how the plugin was made, you will briefly see a non-interactive window pop up. This allows for content to be added to your clipboard.\n* In addition, the same limitations that apply to OCR.Space's API free tier applies obviously to this plugin, such as file size limit, and rate limiting.

This plugin will do it for you!\n\nThis plugin will let you do this:\n\n1. Manage style references on a selected node\n2. Auto-update all references as you change origins (keep the plugin open for this)\n3. Export references to make it available for third-party consumers\n4. Switch contexts\n\n# 1. Manage References\n\nSelect a node for which you want to manage references, eg. a rectangle. Open the \"Style References\" plugin and a dialog will appear that let you do it. Currently these styles are supported:\n\n- Fill Style\n- Stroke Style\n- Effect Style\n\nFor each of those there is a section in the dialog where you can manage the origin style to the reference.\n\n- **Origin** That's the _original_ style.\n- **Reference** That's the style to which the origin is copied over when references are updated.\n\n## Transforms\n\nFor paint styles (Fill and Stroke) transforms are available. When styles\nare referenced from origin to reference you can put transforms in between.\nAvailabe are HSL + Opacity values. They will be applied during\nreferencing.\n\nUse this to automate your color palette. Make one color swatch for your\nbase value (e.g. \"Brand / 500\"). A darker color would take your base value as\nreference and set lightness to \"-20\" - name it for example \"Brand / 300\".\n\n# 2. Export\n\nYou can export your references to jsonbin.io and by that make it available for third-party consumers, e.g. if you want to update your design tokens in your code. Here is how:\n\nEnter credentials in settngs:\n\n1. Create an account and copy the API Key\n2. Create a bin and copy the bin URL\n\nOn the tools tab the `Export Settings` button becomes available. Clicking the button will export your references.\n\n# 3. Import\n\nYou can import your earlier exported references from jsonbin.io. That is really helpful when you duplicated your document - figma will not copy over your stored references. Here is how to import references:\n\n1. Duplicate a document\n2. Open the old document, open the plugin, go to settings and copy the Bin URL\n3. Go the new new document (the plugin should still be opened), paste the URL into the input for import and click the button next to it.\n4. A notification will appear telling you how much references were imported.\n5. You can work with your new document the same way as the old one now - win!\n\n# 4. Contexts\n\nContexts are a lightweight way to organize various theme modes within one document. E.g. if you have light and dark mode in one document, you may want to give styles for respective styles a specific suffix, e.g. `.$dark` - With defined contexts, you can swap between them quickly and then use Themer to export them.\n\n## Workflow Suggestion\n\nUse it in combination with Themer:\n\n1. Set your variants for each context (`§light` and `§dark`)\n2. Select a context\n3. Use `Style References` to map those \"compiled\" styles\n4. Use `Themer` to export and apply them\n\n### Things to Know\n\n- When setting the origin style the suggestions only show local styles, that is also due to limitations of the current figma API, given security reasons for shared team libraries. That's fair - figma keeps us safe, give them credit for that :)\n\nIt still is possible to use library styles, then you can't use the style references manage dialog, instead manually assign those style and THEN use the style references dialog in order to persist it.\n\n- Once you have one node \"under management\", you may want to change the local style but once you update references, those new ones will be overridden. Re-select the node again and the references dialog will provide you options for migrating styles, to either keep the old one or use the new one.\n\n- Once you link origin to reference the node itself will show the reference as its local style, which might give you wonders, yet is expected and the correct behavior.","lastUpdateDate":"2020-06-07T12:13:14.648Z","tags":[null],"publisherHandle":"gossi","publisherId":"891","publisherName":"Thomas Gossmann","installCount":767,"likeCount":24,"viewCount":32126},{"id":"844318739744428676","name":"Theme Switcher","description":"Are you looking for a plugin that lets you quickly switch between multi-branded style sheets, improves your workflow, and reduces work-time by 25%?

Use it for color, text and effect styles.\n\nHow does it work?\nThemer associates published styles with a theme name. When you have multiple themes, Themer will swap styles that match across themes: which means you need two styles with the same names in each theme.\n\nIn order for Themer to be used across your team, generic information about your styles is shared on a external service (jsonbin.io). You will need an account with an API key to get started (You can easily sign in with Google, GutHub or Twitter).\n\nWatch the setup video on YouTube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM8SkksBy3Y&feature=youtu.be\n\n1. Insert your API key from JSONbin\n\n2. Create your first theme, giving it a unique name, and then choose where you want to pull the styles from (all local styles, styles used on the page, or a selection).\n\n*Tip*: If all of your styles exist within one document, you can also prefix your style names with 'theme1/' or 'theme2/' and set Themer to generate multiuple themes at once.\n\n3. With your themes created, you can now apply them to a selection or the entire page. Remember, your design must make use of the same styles from one of the themes to work.\n\nPrivacy:\nThemer stores information about your styles at a service external to Figma. For each theme, we store the name of the theme, the name of the style, the type of style (color, text, effect), and a unique key required to import your styles into a document from your team library. No other data from your file is sent to Jsonbin. Your unique API key is storred locally as well, so if you use Themer across devices, between team members, or between Figma Desktop and Figma in the browser, you will need to re-enter your API key and your Bin URL so that everyone/everywhere has access to the same list of Themes.\n\nRemember to publish your styles before creating a Theme :)\n\nRoadmap:\n• Currently Themer does not yet work text boxes which contan multiple text styles, the plan is to enable this in the near future","lastUpdateDate":"2020-05-07T01:19:38.961Z","tags":[null],"publisherHandle":"tom","publisherId":"35","publisherName":"Tom Lowry","installCount":16006,"likeCount":246,"viewCount":472383},{"id":"772499949564209716","name":"Third","description":"A Figma plugin that lets you import, lit, use and render 3D models right there in Figma 🙈\n\nWatch the video https://youtu.be/XRP-9JM7h4A to see how to use the Third plugin for Figma.\n\n💡 Features\n-   ⚡ A viewport to interact with 3D models.\n-   🔥 High resolution and transparent rendering.\n-   😽 Easy to use UI.\n-   ✨ Supports multiple 3D Object model format for import.\n-   🚀 Lightweight.\n\n🤔 TODOS\nAdd support for postprocessing effects such as\n* Color grading.\n* Bloom.\n* Vignette and Dither.","lastUpdateDate":"2019-12-14T21:54:33.053Z","tags":[null],"publisherHandle":"victor_aremu","publisherId":"203619","publisherName":"Victor Aremu","installCount":2117,"likeCount":60,"viewCount":38682},{"id":"776033210163988440","name":"Thrshold","description":"Apply simple Threshold Effect Filter on images.

Easily send your design texts from Figma to Transifex’s powerful translation management system (TMS) to get them translated. Pull the translated texts back to Figma to validate internationalization (i18n) and resolve any translation issues before coding begins. \n\nLet your designers preview the localized designs and make all necessary adjustments right away, to avoid costly delays in refactoring localization bugs and give your localization users a great UX. Give your translators rich context with screenshots to let them understand where and how the translation will appear so that they deliver higher quality translations. \n\nBoost collaboration between your designers and translators. Deliver new digital experiences faster. \n\nUsing with Transifex\nConnecting Figma with Transifex\n\n1. Make sure that you have access to at least one organization and one project in Transifex.\n2. Install the “Transifex Figma Plugin” in your Figma app.\n3. Open your Figma file. \n4. Go to plugins and select “Transifex Figma Plugin”.\n6. Add your Transifex credentials in the “Settings” tab: First you need to connect with Transifex using an API token. Generate this token from your Transifex account under User Settings => API token. After generating the token, copy and paste it in the related input box in the Figma plugin and click “Connect”.\n\nYou should complete the following plugin settings after connecting with Transifex:\nOrganization: the desired organization to work with.\nProject: the desired project that these Figma strings will be associated with.\nResource: the desired resource of the selected project to push strings to. If you don’t have any resources you can try to create one using the action “Create a new resource” (note that you should have the adequate permissions in order to perform this action).\n\nAfter setting the options, click “Save”.\n\nUsing the plugin\n\n1. Start selecting the Figma layers that you want to send, or “push”, to your Transifex resource for translation.\n2. Your selection will collect your text layers as strings in the main window of the plugin, under both the “Push strings to Transifex” and “Pull strings from Transifex” tabs.\n3. To remove any unwanted strings from the selection in the “Push” or “Pull” tabs, click the X to the right of the string. That string will be removed from the current selection list.\n4. Click the “Push” button to send the selected strings to Transifex and add them to the connected resource. After pushing the strings you can check to see that they were successfully sent using the “View resource in Transifex” link. Also you have the option to upload screenshots if you have selected “Upload Screenshots”. The strings will be translated according to the workflow set up in the Transifex project.\n5. By default the plugin will automatically generate screenshots of your Figma frames and include them with the pushed strings in Transifex. The strings for translation will be automatically mapped to the screenshots in Transifex to provide visual context of your Figma designs to your translators and ensure the quality of the translation. Optionally you can disable screenshot generation for any string push by deselecting the “Upload Screenshots” checkbox in the “Push Strings to Transifex” tab.\n6. You can use the “Replace Resource Strings” feature to clean extra or outdated strings out of your Transifex resources. if this option is checked when you click the “Push” button to send strings to Transifex, then all of the strings currently in the connected resource will be purged and replaced with the current selection only. This option should be used carefully, especially with resources shared by other users. If you are sure you want to replace all the strings in the resource with the current selection, click “OK” in the confirmation dialog. The resource strings will be replaced, and the “Replace” option will be reset to deactivated. All of your previous translations remain in the translation memory (TM) so you and your team can reuse them, unless they are also deleted from the TM in Transifex.\n7. To pull translations back from Transifex to Figma, first select the Figma layers you want to get translations for and then click the “Pull” button in the “Pull Strings from Transifex” tab. You have the option to pull them in all languages or in a specific one by selecting it in the “Language” dropdown. The pull operation will create a new page in your Figma file for every language with the same name of the selected page and the language code as prefix, and automatically insert translations for the selected strings.\n\nAbout Transifex\nFounded in Greece and now headquartered in Silicon Valley, Transifex helps companies - from Startups to the Enterprise - go global.
